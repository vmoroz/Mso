// The FutureState must be limited to 8 states to ensure that it can be fit into three bits.
// The three bits become available because we require that all continuation pointers are aligned by 8 bytes.
// It allows us to store FutureState along with a continuation pointer in the same atomic variable.
// This way we can avoid using mutexes and do the synchronization using only atomic operations.
//
// - FutureState::Pending is the initial state of a Future.
// - FutureState::Posting is when the Future starts processing.
// - FutureState::Posted is when the Future is posted for asynchronous invocation.
// - FutureState::Invoking is set before we start to invoke a task. It helps us ensure that task is invoked only once.
// - FutureState::Awaiting is used when task invocation completed, but we have to wait for the returned future to
//   complete.
// - FutureState::SettingResult is set before we start setting the return value or error code.
// - FutureState::Succeeded is the final state indicating that Future is completed successfully and its value is set.
// - FutureState::Failed is the final state indicating that the execution of the Future is failed and we have an error
//   code.

// "Pending" can move to:
// - 'Posting'       - when we have a task to invoke, or we have FutureOptions::UseParentValue where we need to
//                     set a link back to the parent).
// - 'SettingResult' - when there is no task to invoke or when we want to set error code before processing starts.
// "Posting" can move to:
// - 'Invoking'      - when associated task is about to be invoked synchronously in the same thread.
// - 'Posted'        - when task is scheduled for asynchronous execution.
// - 'SettingResult' - when there is no task to invoke or we get an error while posting the task.
// "Posted" can move to:
// - 'Invoking'      - when associated task is about to be invoked as a part of asynchronous execution.
// - 'SettingResult' - when task is canceled before the invocation started.
// "Invoking" can move to:
// - 'Awaiting'      - when task is invoked but we have to wait for returned future to provide result.
// - 'SettingResult' - when task is invoked and we start setting result value or error code.
// "Awaiting" can move to:
// - 'SettingResult' - when returned future is completed we start setting result value or error code.
// "SettingResult" can move to:
// - 'Succeeded'     - when future is succeeded and result value is set.
// - 'Failed'        - when future is failed and error code is set.
//
// The three states: 'Posting', 'Invoking', and 'SettingResult' assume that we are changing other Future variables.
// Getting to these states is similar to acquiring a lock. We set a pointer to the current future in a current
// thread's TLS variable. When we move to a different state we 'release' the lock and clean the TLS variable.
// We can only move to a different state from these three 'locking' states in the same thread where we 'acquired' them.
//
// Promise moves to the FutureState::SettingResult state before we start to set value or error code, and then moves to
// the FutureState::Succeeded or FutureState::Failed states.
//
// Future first moves to FutureState::Posting. If the task must be invoked asynchronously, then it moves
// to FutureState::Post state. After that it moves to the FutureState::Invoking state before task invocation starts.
// It moves to FutureState::SettingResult after the callback finished execution and it needs to set the result value or
// error code. In case when Future's lambda returns another future, which must be completed before returning result, it
// moves to the FutureState::Awaiting state. When the returned future is completed, it moves to
// FutureState::SettingResult state to set value or error code. A Future accepts setting failure from another thread
// while it is not in a 'locking' state: FutureState::Pending, FutureState::Posted, FutureState::Awaiting. In the
// 'locking' states failure can be set only from the thread that currently executes the Future. Future gets to failed
// state when it is canceled, invoked task returns an error code, or previous future failed and our future did not
// handle the error, and this error just propagated to our future.
//
// Promise or Future return value can only be initialized after the state is set to FutureState::SettingResult and then
// to FutureState::Succeeded. Otherwise, we consider the value storage to be uninitialized and do not call the value
// destructor.
//
// For the failures we also first move to FutureState::SettingResult state, set the ErrorCode, and then move to the
// FutureState::Failed state.
